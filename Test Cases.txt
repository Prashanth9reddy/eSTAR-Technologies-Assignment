Test Cases

Assumption:
	As temperature sensor is not available, following cases are used to test the code. 



1) Sample Test Cases:
	
	1. Make Sure That MANUAL_TEST macro is defined at the time of Compilation.
	2. By doing this the user will be asked to enter 10 Inputs.
	3. Enter Numerical data for initial Verification.
	4. Enter a non numeriacal charecter to check weather porgram is prompting user for valid input or not.
	5. Check Weather iteration is resumed from the same place where user got promted for Valid Input.
	6. Continue giving Inputs with some charecters in between as explained above.
	7. Make sure to give negative values too.
	8. After entering 10 Values Observe the Averages in Centigrade and Fahrenheit with 0.1%

2) Internal Test Cases:

	1. Make Sure That SELF_TEST macro is defined at the time of Compilation.
	2. By doing this the program will call a function that generates random temperature samples and will return total value.
	3. As it is an infinite process the averages of temperatures in centigrades and fharenheit are displayed on console with 0.1 resolution
	
	
	
	
Note:-
		*The range of temperature readings on Self Test Mode Can Be adjusted by Changing TEST_RANGE Variable which generates in both positive and negative ranges.
